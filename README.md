# SAS-Study
* This is repository dedicating specifically for my SAS study. I pick this up for job perspective mostly but it is very interesting to learn as well. There are bunch of materials that I created, some from the lectures on Udemy courses that I took. [Link](https://www.udemy.com/sascompletetutorial/learn/v4/) and [Link](https://www.udemy.com/complete-practical-sas-statistics-data-analysis-course/learn/v4/overview). I also made some files just to learn how to play around what I have done. 
* While I understand this is very basic, it is helpful to put note on those in case I forget and need to for reference in the future. 
* I am by no means confident in my skill at SAS comparing to Python and R, but I believe I will be able to get better in a forseeable future.
